<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>

My name is Tyler Anderson and I'm a student at <b>Florida Gulf Coast University</b>.

<br>
<br>

I am currently in my second year of my Bachelor's in Software Engineering path.
</p>

<h2>

Hobbies

</h2>

<p>

In my spare time, I like to play video games on my PS3 and PC, I dabble in "art" from time to time and other times I animate. I frequent the gym in North Lake and travel back and forth 
to Saint Augustine, Florida. I'm originally from Pompano Beach, Florida but now I live on campus.

<br>
<br>

I'm patiently waiting for season 4 of Rick and Morty (should only take about 3 decades). In the meantime, I watch anime and <i>The Office</i> and attempt to find other means of 
entertainment.

</p>

<h2>

Personality

</h2>

<p>

At heart, I'm a very quiet person. As a matter of fact, I have to strain my voice to speak at a normal volume in loud scenarios, like a classroom when everyone 
is talking amongst themselves. After a few minutes of speaking that way I normally lose my voice for the rest of the day.

<br>
<br>

I'm also terrible at being social.
